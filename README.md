# Automating Real World Tasks with Python

This repo contains scripts for the final projects of the,
Google IT Automation with Python Professional Certificate. 

The repo will have several scripts.

Currently the only script is image_processing. 

This script will open, rotate, resize image files,
and save the changes to a different directory.
