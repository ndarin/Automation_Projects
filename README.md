# Automating Real World Tasks with Python

This repo contains scripts for three of the final projects of the,
Google IT Automation with Python Professional Certificate.

The repo has several automation scripts.

The mini-project scripts in the repo include:

Project
image_processing.py - This script will open, rotate, resize image files,
and save the changes to a different directory.

Project
reviews.py - The script processes customer reviews stored in text files,
and makes API calls to a Django-based web service that displays the reviews on a website.

Project
cars.py - This script accepts and processes a json file on car sales,
summarises maximum values, generates a pdf report and emails it. Its
dependencies are: reports.py and emails.py

Other files
auto_mailer.py - A template script for creating and sending emails.
car_sales.json - Contains data on car sales.
